**PE01**
**Process:**
The application uses React Native components to display user-specific information. There is no requirement for user input from outside. The static input is hardcoded directly into the source code.

**Input:**
The app is structured with the component-based architecture of React Native. When the app is executed, it invokes the HelloWorldApp function, which is a View that contains three styled Text objects. The styles are defined using StyleSheet.create, providing a yellow background and centered positioning with customized font styling. The View centers all Text objects both vertically and horizontally.
The development followsthebest practices withthe use ofmodular, reusable, and readable code. The app does not rely on userinput, APIs, or state management, resulting in the logic being plain and display-centric.

**Output:**
The end product is a well-formatted mobile screen with yellow background user information. It displays the name, study program, and school at the center of the screen. The application is a basic React Native UI rendering example using hardcoded data.
